# BookSwap Marketplace - Project Summary

## 🎯 What is BookSwap?

BookSwap is a **full-stack Node.js API** that enables users to exchange used books. Think of it as a "Craigslist for books" where users can:

1. **List their books** for others to see
2. **Browse available books** from other users
3. **Request books** they want to borrow/exchange
4. **Manage requests** (accept/decline) for their own books

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Backend Stack
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: MySQL with Sequelize ORM
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with bcrypt password hashing
- **File Uploads**: Multer for book cover images
- **Validation**: Joi schema validation
- **Security**: Helmet, CORS protection

### Database Design
- **Users**: Store user accounts (name, email, hashed password)
- **Books**: Store book listings (title, author, condition, owner)
- **BookRequests**: Track book exchange requests (status: pending/accepted/declined)

## 🔄 Core User Workflows

### 1. User Registration & Authentication
```
User signs up → Account created → User logs in → JWT token issued
```

### 2. Book Listing Process
```
User creates book listing → Book saved to database → Other users can see it
```

### 3. Book Exchange Process
```
User A lists a book → User B requests it → User A accepts/declines → Exchange completed
```

## 📊 API Endpoints Summary

### Authentication (2 endpoints)
- `POST /auth/signup` - Create new account
- `POST /auth/login` - Login and get JWT token

### User Management (1 endpoint)
- `GET /users/me` - Get current user profile

### Book Management (5 endpoints)
- `POST /books` - Create new book listing
- `GET /books` - List all available books
- `GET /books/mine` - List user's own books
- `PUT /books/:id` - Update book details
- `DELETE /books/:id` - Remove book listing

### Request Management (3 endpoints)
- `POST /requests` - Request a book from another user
- `GET /requests/mine` - View user's requests
- `PATCH /requests/:id/status` - Accept/decline requests

## 🔐 Security Features

1. **Password Security**: bcrypt hashing with salt rounds
2. **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based sessions
3. **Input Validation**: All requests validated with Joi schemas
4. **CORS Protection**: Cross-origin request handling
5. **Helmet Security**: HTTP headers protection
6. **File Upload Security**: Type and size validation

## 🗄️ Database Schema

### Users Table
```sql
- id (UUID, Primary Key)
- name (VARCHAR, Required)
- email (VARCHAR, Unique, Required)
- password (VARCHAR, Hashed, Required)
- createdAt, updatedAt (Timestamps)
```

### Books Table
```sql
- id (UUID, Primary Key)
- title (VARCHAR, Required)
- author (VARCHAR, Required)
- condition (ENUM: new, like_new, good, fair, poor)
- imageUrl (VARCHAR, Optional)
- ownerId (UUID, Foreign Key to Users)
- createdAt, updatedAt (Timestamps)
```

### BookRequests Table
```sql
- id (UUID, Primary Key)
- status (ENUM: pending, accepted, declined, Default: pending)
- bookId (UUID, Foreign Key to Books)
- requesterId (UUID, Foreign Key to Users)
- createdAt, updatedAt (Timestamps)
```
